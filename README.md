# Bastion Host - AWS CDK and .NET 6
Implementing Secure Connections with a Bastion Host using AWS CDK and .NET

This repository contains a comprehensive guide on how to implement secure connections to services within private subnets using a Bastion Host with AWS CDK and .NET. The main focus is on the practical application of AWS CDK with .NET, providing a detailed explanation of all essential components needed to deploy a fully functional bastion host.

## What are we going to do and why?

When designing your system, it’s crucial to pay attention to security. This guide focuses on one common use case: how to provide secure access to our servers in private subnets without exposing them to the public internet. Within AWS, this can be achieved through at least three different methods:

- VPN: We can configure a VPN on the local environment and our VPC on AWS, enabling access to private subnets.
- AWS Direct Connect: This service allows us to set up a secure physical connection between our local network and AWS.
- Bastion host: We can configure a special EC2 instance that facilitates communication with our resources in a private subnet on AWS.

In this guide, the focus is on the more cost-effective and simpler-to-configure option: the bastion host.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have configured the necessary items from the list below:

- AWS CDK
- AWS CLI
- Session Manager Plugin
- Node.js and npm
- .NET (which you should already have)

## Walkthrough

The guide provides a detailed walkthrough of creating the application, setting up the network, and creating a bastion host. It also includes code snippets for each step, making it easier to follow along.

## Code Structure

The codebase is structured into two main parts. The first part defines the network we’ll use in this example. The second part is responsible for the rest of our infrastructure components. Each part is described in further detail using examples.

## Network

For our use case, we will need a VPC in which our components will be placed. The guide provides a detailed explanation of how to set up the VPC, including allocating IPs for a network, adding internet access for our components in private subnets, creating subnets, and setting up a network traffic monitoring mechanism in a VPC.

## Creating a Bastion Host

The guide provides a step-by-step process of creating a bastion host, including creating a security group for the bastion host, creating an EC2 instance for our bastion host, and setting up a security group for our RDS.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of implementing secure connections with a Bastion Host using AWS CDK and .NET. It is a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their knowledge on leveraging AWS services like AWS RDS Postgres and discover effective ways to maintain network security.
